This also allows the Justices to rule without concern of political pressures or personal biases as a result of upcoming elections. This allows for more deliberation and judicious consideration of cases brought before the Court. Additionally, since only the Senate has the Constitutional power to remove a Justice, having a Lifetime appointment provides a significant degree of security and job tenure as well. This is meant to ensure that Judges focus more on upholding the Constitution instead of their own political agendas or personal career aspirations. The Lifetime appointment of Supreme Court Justices is an important element for a stable and effective judiciary system, in my opinion."}]}
